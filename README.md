# 2D Breakout Game

It's a 2D breakout game made in pure JavaScript, basically this game started from a little training I did on MDN to introduce myself to 2D games on the web with classic technologies ( HTML, CSS, JS).
The principle of the game is:

- a user has three lives,
- he must destroy all the bricks while avoiding that the ball touches the lower part of the playing arena with the racket,
- if all the bricks are destroyed, he wins, otherwise he loses and can restart the game.
